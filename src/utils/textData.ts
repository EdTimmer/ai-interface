  "Tao (The Way) that can be spoken of is not the Constant Tao'\nThe name that can be named is not a Constant Name.\nNameless, is the origin of Heaven and Earth;\nThe named is the Mother of all things.\nThus, the constant void enables one to observe the true essence.\nThe constant being enables one to see the outward manifestations.\nThese two come paired from the same origin.\nBut when the essence is manifested,\nIt has a different name.\nThis same origin is called \"The Profound Mystery.\"\nAs profound the mystery as It can be,\nIt is the Gate to the essence of all life.",
  
  "As soon as beauty is known by the world as beautiful, it becomes ugly.\nAs soon as virtue is being known as something good, it becomes evil.\nTherefore being and non-being give birth to each other.\nDifficult and easy accomplish each other.\nLong and short form each other.\nHigh and low distinguish each other.\nSound and tone harmonize each other\nBefore and after follow each other as a sequence.\nRealizing this, the saint performs effortlessly according to the natural Way without personal\ndesire, and practices the wordless teaching thru one's deeds.\nThe saint inspires the vitality of all lives, without holding back.\nHe nurtures all beings with no wish to take possession of.\nHe devotes all his energy but has no intention to hold on to the merit.\nWhen success is achieved, he seeks no recognition.\nBecause he does not claim for the credit, hence shall not lose it.",
  
  "By not adoring the worthy, people will not fall into dispute.\nBy not valuing the hard to get objects, people will not become robbers.\nBy not seeing the desires of lust, one's heart will not be confused.\nTherefore the governing of the saint is to empty one's mind, substantiate one's virtue, weaken\none's worldly ambition and strengthen one's essence.\nHe lets the people to be innocent of worldly knowledge and desire, and keeps the clever ones\nfrom making trouble with their wits.\nActs naturally without desire, then everything will be accomplished in its natural order.",
  
  "Tao (The Way) can be infused into the nature and put to use without being exhausted.\nIt is so deep and subtle like an abyss that is the origin of all things.\nIt is complete and perfect as a wholeness that can\n Round off sharp edges;\n Resolve confusion;\n Harmonize with the glory;\n Act in unity with the lowliness.\nTao is so profound and yet in invisible, It exists in everywhere and anywhere.\nI don not know whose Son It is, It existed before heaven and earth.",
  
  "Nature nurtures all things with the wholeness of complete virtue.\nIt shows the greatest and perfect kindness by giving life to let all things grow and accomplish\nthem with the hastening of harvest.\nTherefore, according to ancient custom, nature may seem unkind to regard all beings as a\ntraditional straw dog for sacrifice.\nAnd likewise with a saint, he may seem unkind to regard people as a traditional straw dog for\nsacrifice.\nThe space between heaven and earth is like the bellows, it appears empty yet it gives a supply\nthat never fails;\nThe more it moves, the more it brings forth.\nMany words lead to exhaustion.\nIt is better to center on the true essence within.",
  
  "Spirit of the valley is immortal.\nIt is called the mystic nature.\nThe gate o f the mystic nature is regarded as the root of the universe.\nIt is everlasting and cannot be consumed.",
  
  "Heaven is everlasting and earth is enduring.\nThe reason that they are everlasting is because they do not exist for themselves.\nHence, they are long lived.\nThus, although the saint puts himself last, finds himself in the lead.\nAlthough he is not self-concerned, finds himself accomplished.\nIt is because he is not focused on self-interests and hence can fulfill his true nature.",
  
  "A person of great virtue is like the flowing water.\nWater benefits all things and contends not with them.\nIt puts itself in a place that no one wishes to be and thus is closest to Tao.\nA virtuous person is like water which adapts itself to the perfect place.\nHis mind is like the deep water that is calm and peaceful.\nHis heart is kind like water that benefits all.\nHis words are sincere like the constant flow of water.\nHis governing is natural without desire which is like the softness of water that penetrates through\nhard rocks.\nHis work is of talent like the free flow of water.\nHis movement is of right timing like water that flows smoothly.\nA virtuous person never forces his way and hence will not make faults.",
  
  "Those who overly pride wealth is like the overflowing water which shall cause damages. It is\nbetter to restrain early.\nThose who are not content with fame is like polishing the edge of a knife.\nThe sharper it gets, the easier it is to break.\nWealth and treasures are but illusions that one cannot possess.\nThose who are arrogant of their wealth and fame shall invite blame upon oneself.\nThe nature Tao teaches one to retreat after one's success and not to hold on to the credit.",
  
  "Can one unite the body and the spirit as one and embrace the \"Oneness\" without departing from\nthe great Tao?\nCan one achieve harmony with such gentleness by holding on to the true spirit within as if the\ninnocence of an infant?\nCan one free oneself from worldly knowledge and cleanse one's mind, so that no faults shall be\nmade?\nCan a ruler love his people by governing with the natural Way without personal intention?\nCan the mystic gate to all life essence be opened or closed without the virtue of the mysterious\nnature?\nCan one gain the insight of nature and become a wise person without the effort of action?\nThe mysterious nature creates and nurtures all things without the desire to possess them.\nIt performs with all efforts without claiming for credit.\nIt flourishes all beings without the intention to take control of.\nSuch is the \"Mystic Te\" or \"Mystic Virtue.\"",
  
  "Thirty spokes unite around one hub to make a wheel.\nIt is the presence of the empty space that gives the function of a vehicle.\nClay is molded into a vessel. It is the empty space that gives the function of a vessel.\nDoors and windows are chisel out to make a room.\nIt is the empty space in the room that gives its function.\nTherefore, something substantial can be beneficial.\nWhile the emptiness of void is what can be utilized.",

  "Honor and disgrace can surprise a person.\nThe greatest distress lies in one's physical body.\nWhat does it men by \"Honor and disgrace can surprise someone?\"\nHonor is inferior, because one who wins the favor is afraid of losing it.\nAnd one who loses the favor is frightened with distress.\nThis is the significance of \"Honor and disgrace can surprise someone.\"\nWhat does it mean by \"The greatest distress lies in one's body?\"\nWe have fear because we worry about our physical self.\nIf one's body does not exist, how can one has fear?\nTherefore, he who values the world as much as he values himself, can be entrusted with the\nruling of the world.\nHe who loves the world as much as he loves himself, can be entrusted with the guidance of the\nworld.",
  
  "What cannot be seen is called the invisible.\nWhat cannot be heard is called the inaudible.\nWhat cannot be touched is called the intangible.\nThese three cannot be examined and comprehended.\nAnd hence are mixed together as one.\nThis \"Oneness\" is not much brighter in the sky, as It is not much dimmer on earth.\nIt is not more glorious in a saint as It is not more fainter in an ordinary person.\nIt is everlasting and cannot be named.\nIt is the original void of \"non-being.\"\nThis \"Oneness\" is the Tao which is invisible, and formless.\nIt may be regarded as vague and intangible.\nWhen the Oneness Tao comes forward, Its front cannot be seen.\nWhen one tries to follow It, one cannot see Its rear.\nBy abiding with the original Tao, one can master the presence.\nHe who knows this \"Origin,\" shall know the teaching and principle of the Great Tao.",
  
  "The ancient Tao cultivators were subtle and mysterious.\nThey were of immeasurable profundity.\nBecause they were too subtle to be known, so reluctantly they were being described as follow:\nCautious, as if crossing an icy river.\nHesitant, as if fearful of the surroundings.\nReverent, like an honorable guest.\nDispersed, like winter ice began to melt in spring.\nSimple and sincere, like a genuine virgin.\nOpen-minded, like an empty valley.\nHarmonized, like the turbid water.\nHow can one turn the turbid water into clarity?\nA person of Tao would maintain peace in order to achieve pureness of the mind.\nAnd therefore shall not be disturbed by the worldly desires.\nAfter achieving pureness of the mind, how can one let it be everlasting?\nA person of Tao would unify and harmonize himself with all beings which shall lead to eternity.\nThose who abide by this Tao will not indulge themselves in the desire of greed.\nIt is because of this humbleness that enables one to embrace the original \"Oneness,\" the Great\nTao.",
  
  "Human must achieve the ultimate void and maintain calmness with sincerity in order to observe\nthe growth and flourish of all beings.\nIt is in this way that one can understand the law of nature.\nAll things and beings will eventually return to the original source.\nThis is called \"peace.\"\n\"Peace\" means returning to one's original nature.\nThis original nature is the eternal law. To know the nature's law is to be enlightened.\nHe who is ignorant of the nature's law shall act recklessly, and thus will invite misfortune.\nTo know the constant law of nature is to be generous.\nBeing generous, one is impartial.\nBeing impartial, one is the sovereign.\nSovereign is the nature itself.\nNature is Tao. Tao is everlasting.\nWhen one's physical body dies away, Tao still long endures.",
  
  "In early ancient mankind, Tao has been in existence in one's true nature.\nMen possess It without knowing.\nOne then acts with virtue and honor which is inferior to Tao.\nThe less superior is to act with fear.\nAnd the least superior is to act with disgrace.\nThis occurs because one does not have enough faith, and hence has no confidence.\nThe nature of Tao is distinguished by wordless teaching with the natural act of virtue without\naction.\nAs such, people would act effortlessly and harmonize with the Nature Tao.",
  
  "When Great Tao declines, virtue of humanity and righteousness shall arise.\nWhen knowledge and intelligence appear, great hypocrisy shall arise.\nWhen the six various family relationships are not in harmony, filial piety and compassion shall\narise.\nWhen a country is in chaos, the loyal officials shall appear.",
  
  "Transcend the saint's teaching and conceal one's wisdom for potential use, shall benefit the\npeople a hundred fold.\nExtend kindness to its ultimate and then polish to refine one's righteousness shall help the people\nor regain filial piety and compassion.\nEmploy one's subtle true nature with exquisiteness and extend one's personal benefit to share\nwith others, shall eliminate robbers and thieves.\nThese three statements are apparent superficial and not sufficient to express the natural \"Way\" of\nthe great Tao.\nHence, this is what people should do:\nReturn to their original true self and embrace the pure \"Oneness.\"\nRefrain selfness and diminish worldly desires.",
  
  "Enlightenment of the absolute Tao can free a person from worries and sorrow.\nHow much is the difference between a respectful response and an angry response?\nHow great is the difference between good and evil?\nWhat people naturally fear, one should also fear.\nOne's endless desire can result in negligence of the true nature of life.\nPeople like to pursue after excitement as if they were ascending the terrace in spring and\ncelebrate a sacrificial feast.\nBut I alone remain quiet and calm like an infant who is pure and innocent.\nAnd I alone appeared to be lost like one who has nowhere to go.\nAll people have a surplus, but I alone was simple and left out like a fool.\nPeople seemed bright and shrewd, while I seemed dull.\nPeople like to dispute, while I alone remain quiet.\nI am calm and peaceful like the boundless ocean.\nI am open-hearted and free like the wind blowing high above the sky without hindrance.\nEveryone thinks of themselves as capable and outstanding while I appeared unlearned.\nI am the only one to be different from others for I value highly the Great Tao and joyfully act\naccordingly.",
  
  "A man of great virtue is one who follows the nature way of Tao.\nThis Tao is vague and intangible.\nYet, in the vague and void, there is image, there is substance.\nWithin the profound intangible, there is essence;\nThis essence is genuine.\nIn It lies the great faith.\nSince the beginning of the world, Tao has been in existence.\nOnly through It that one can understand the origin of all beings.\nHow do I know that this is the true essence?\nIt is through this natural Way.",
  
  "To yield is to preserve the whole.\nTo be misjudged is to be straightened.\nTo be hollow is to be filled.\nTo be battered is to be renewed.\nTo be in need is to possess.\nTo be abundant is to be confused.\nTherefore, the saint embraces the \"Oneness\" as a standard for the world.\nThe wise one is not prejudiced, hence he is enlightened.\nThe wise one is not self-opinioned, hence he is outstanding.\nThe wise one does not boast of himself, hence he shall receive the credit.\nThe wise one does not praise his own deeds, hence can long endure.\nBecause the wise one does not conflict with others and therefore the world cannot contend\nagainst him.\nIt is not true as the ancients say, \"To yield is to preserve the whole?\"\nThus the \"Oneness\" will be honored to him.",
  
  "Words that cannot be heard of are natural.\nA gale can not blow for the whole morning.\nA rainstorm cannot last for the whole day.\nWhat caused these effects?\nHeaven and earth.\nEven the actions of nature do not last long.\nHow much more can human's behavior last when digressed from the natural Tao?\nThus, one who follows the Great Tao,\nWhen Tao is present, he will benefit the world with Tao.\nWhen Te is present, he will benefit the world with Te.\nWhen Tao and Te are both lost, he identifies himself with the people and benefits them with the\nenlightenment of teaching.\nOne who identifies with Tao is glad to be with Tao.\nOne who identifies with Te is glad to be with Te.\nOne who identifies with the loss of Tao and Te is glad to be with the lost.\nIf one does not have enough faith in \"Tao,\" how can he assist others to practice with faith?",
  
  "He who raises himself on tiptoe cannot stand firm.\nHe who walks with strides cannot travel far.\nHe who is self-opinioned shall not be enlightened.\nHe who is prejudiced shall not be recognized.\nHe who brags about himself shall not receive credit.\nHe who is arrogant shall not make improvements.\nIn view of Tao, people who are self-centered are like the surplus food and redundant actions in\neveryday life.\nAll things disgust them.\nTherefore a person of Tao will not conduct himself in such manner.",
  
  "Something is formed in the chaos, which existed before heaven and earth.\nIt is quiet and profound.\nIt stands alone and alters not.\nIt revolves eternally without exhaustion.\nIt is regarded as the Mother of all beings.\nI do not know Its name, except to call It Tao.\nWhen forced to give It a name, I would call It \"the Great.\"\nThe Great is far-reaching.\nFar-reaching is infinite.\nInfinite is to return to the self-sufficient origin.\nTherefore, Tao is great, heaven is great, earth is great, and so is the true-self.\nThere are four greatness in the universe, and true-self is one of them.\nMan models the Way of earth;\nEarth models the Way of heaven;\nHeaven models the Way of Tao;\nTao models the Way of nature.",
  
  "The heavy is the fundamental of the light. Tranquility is the master of agitation.\nTherefore, the saint always conducts himself with the essence of Tao and never departs from It.\nAlthough he is surrounded by the splendor of wealth, he remains to live a simple and ordinary\nlife.\nHow can a ruler govern a nation without recklessness if he indulges in power and desire?\nHe who acts recklessly shall lose the essence of Tao.\nHe who is agitated with lust and desires shall lose his true nature.",
  
  "Good deeds leave no signs.\nGood words leave no flaws.\nGood scheme needs no deliberate plans.\nA good lock uses no bolts, yet it cannot be opened.\nA good knot uses no rope, yet it cannot be untied.\nHence, a saint is always kind by saving other people and rejects no one.\nHe is always kind by saving all things and therefore nothing is being rejected.\nThis is the true enlightenment.\nThus, a kind person is the teacher of the unkind.\nAn unkind person is a lesson for the kind to learn.\nHe who does not value his teacher and dislikes the valuable lesson, although knowledgeable, is\nin fact greatly confused.\nThis is the fundamental essence.",
  
  "To know the strong masculine principle, yet abide by the gentle female principle is like being the\nvalley of the world where all rivers will flow into.\nThis is alike all virtue which will merge into the subtle Tao.\nBeing a valley of the world and not depart from the true nature, once can return to original\npureness like an infant.\nWhen one knows the white that is splendor, yet holds on to the black that is humble and lowly.\nHe can be a standard of the world.\nBeing a standard of the world and not deviate from true nature, one is able to return to the void\nof Tao.\nTo know what is honor, yet abide by the dishonored, is like a valley of the world which is\nmodest and humble.\nBeing the valley of the world makes possible the true virtue to be complete and sufficient.\nAnd hence can return to simplicity.\nWhen the nature of simplicity is being manifested, it results into various vessels.\nAnd by applying the pure simplicity, a saint can master all things.\nHence, the Great Tao is a unified Oneness which cannot be separated apart.",
  
  "He who wishes to take control of the world and acts upon it,\nI can see that he will not succeed.\nFor the world is a divine vessel,\nIt cannot be acted upon as one wish.\nHe who acts on it fails.\nHe who holds on to it loses.\nTherefore some things move forward while some follow behind.\nSome try to warm with exhaled air while some try to blow it cold.\nSome are strong while some are weak.\nSome are successfully accomplished while some are declined and failed.\nThus, the saint avoids all extremes, extravagance, and pride.",
  
  "One who assists the ruler with the principle of Tao,\nWill not use the force of arms to conquer the world.\nFor such affairs will result in cause and effect.\nWherever the armies touch the land, it is turned into a wasteland of thorns and brambles.\nAfter a war is fought, bad years are sure to follow.\nTherefore, one who follows the true nature will understand the principle of cause and effect and\nshall not rely upon the strength of force.\nBy knowing the effect, thus one will not brag.\nBy knowing the effect, thus one will not boast.\nBy knowing the effect, thus one will not become arrogant.\nBy knowing the effect, although one has no choice, one still abides with the principle of cause\nand effect and does not resolve into force.\nWhen things reach their prime, they start to age and decline.\nThis is the life that is diminishing and shall not reach the ultimate essence.",
  
  "Weapons of war are instruments of disaster.\nThey are rejected by all beings.\nThus a person of Tao will not dwell upon them.\nAccording to the ancient custom of Ying and Yang,\nA man of virtue values the left which is represented by Yang.\nAnd a man of war values the right which is represented by Ying.\nWeapons are instruments of evil, and are not valued by a man of virtue.\nThey are only used as the last resort to attain peach when all else have failed.\nIf their use is necessary, it is best to employ with calmness and tranquility.\nEven it if means victory, it is not something pleasant.\nThose who rejoice over the victory, enjoy killing.\nHe who delights in killing will not be favored by the people and shall not bring harmony to the\nworld.\nIt is the ancient custom to favor happy events to the left as represented by yang.\nWhile on sad occasions, it is favored to the right as represented by Ying.\nWhen this rite is applied in the army,\nThe lieutenant general takes the place of the left,\nAnd the commander-in-chief takes the place of the right.\nThis indicates that war is treated as if it is a funeral service;\nFor many lives had been killed and hence should be mourned with sorrow.\nTherefore, although a victory was won,\nIt is treated like funeral rite.",
  
  "The universal Tao has no name.\nAlthough It appears in the plainest and may seem small,\nIt is inferior to nothing.\nIf the kings and marquises can abide by the Great Tao,\nAll beings shall act as guests and submit to them.\nHeaven and earth will then be in harmony and shall descend sweet dew.\nPeople will not require command and orders,\nYet can treat each other equally with peace.\nWhen Tao is manifested, names were given for the purpose of distinction.\nBut one must know how to attain the original pureness in order to avoid danger and disaster.\nTao exists in the universe like the rivers and streams that lead to the ocean.",
  
  "One who knows other people is wise.\nOne who knows himself is enlightened.\nTo overcome others is strong.\nTo overcome oneself is the will of power.\nOne who is contented is rich.\nOne who is determined has the strength of will.\nThose who embrace their true nature shall long live.\nHe who is enlightened with the original nature,\nAlthough dies physically, is eternally united with the everlasting Tao.",
  
  "The great Tao is ever present.\nIt can adjust Itself to everything.\nAll things live by It, and It does not deny them.\nWhen Its work is accomplished, It does not claim possession.\nIt gives great love to nurture all things and all lives, but dominates not.\nThe true void of Tao has no desires and may seem small.\nYet all things entrust their lives to It and It does not act as their master.\nThis may be recognized as \"the Great.\"\nBecause a saint does not restrict himself with the greatness,\nHence his greatness is accomplished.",
  
  "He who embraces the Great Tao shall be the guidance of the world.\nBy following him, the world will not be harmed and will be rendered with peace and harmony.\nPleasures and delicacy can only attract passers-by to stay temporarily.\nThe teaching of Tao is plain without extraordinary appearances.\nIt can not be seen,\nIt can not be heard,\nIt can not be depleted or exhausted.",
  
  "It desire shall conceal true self,\nTrue self will manifest itself even more.\nIf desire shall weaken true self,\nTrue self will strengthen itself even more.\nIf desire shall abandon true self,\nTrue self will prosperous even more.\nIf desire shall deprive true self,\nTrue self will give even more.\nThis is known as the enlightened nature that is subtle yet profound.\nGentleness overcomes strength, and the meek overcomes the strong.\nJust as fish live in deep water and cannot survive after being taken out of the depths.\nAnd the powerful weapons of a country should not be displayed,\nJust like one's true nature cannot be revealed to be seen.",
  
  "The everlasting Tao acts according to the natural Way.\nTherefore there is nothing that It will not accomplish.\nIf kings and the nobilities can abide by their true nature and follow the great Tao,\nAll things shall be reformed naturally.\nIf during the process of reform, desires arouse.\nI shall overcome with the simplicity of original nature.\nWith the simplicity of true nature, there shall be no desire.\nWithout desire, one's original nature will be at peace.\nAnd the world will naturally be in accord with the right Way.",
  
  "A man of superior virtue is not conscious of being virtuous, hence is truly virtuous.\nA man of inferior virtue performs for the purpose of virtue, hence he is not virtuous.\nA man of superior virtue acts without action, and performs with his true nature.\nA man of inferior virtue acts with intentional effort.\nA man of superior kindness acts a natural act.\nA man of superior justice acts with righteousness and feelings for others.\nA man of superior etiquette acts according to his true self, hence no one responds to him by\nmoving away.\nThere, when Tai is lost, there is Te (virtue).\nWhen Te is lost, there is humanity.\nWhen humanity is lost, there is justice.\nWhen justice is lost, there is etiquette.\nEtiquette becomes prevalent when people fail to be sincere and honest.\nHence, chaos begins.\nA person of knowledge and self-opinion will be hindered from the enlightenment of Tao.\nThus, this is the beginning of ignorance!\nTherefore, one who cultivates himself with Tao,\nEmbraces the original nature and indulges not in sensual nature.\nHe abides by the fundamental Oneness and indulges not in sensory pleasures.\nThus, abandon those desires and abide by this true essence of Tao.",
  
  "In the beginning, there were those who attained the Oneness;\nHeaven, by attaining the Oneness became clear;\nEarth, by attaining the Oneness became peaceful;\nSpirit, by attaining the Oneness became divine;\nTrue nature is like an empty valley, and by attaining the Oneness,\nIt became fully productive.\nAll things, by attaining the Oneness became alive.\nEmperors and nobilities, by attaining Oneness can bring peace and prosperity to the world.\nAll these are the results of achieving Oneness.\nHeaven, without clarity would crack.\nEarth, without peace would quake.\nSpirit, without divinity would be powerless.\nTrue nature, without productivity would result in exhaustion of life.\nAll things, without life essence would perish.\nEmperors, without Oneness to exalt them to nobility, would stumble and fall.\nThus, honor is based on humbleness.\nThe high builds its foundation upon the low.\nTherefore, the kings and nobles call themselves \"the solitude,\" \"the unworthy,\" and \"the\nvirtueless.\"\nIs this not the reason why they base their honor upon humbleness?\nHence, the highly honored do not regard themselves as nobles and have no wish to be selfcentered to think nobly of themselves as a piece of jade nor to think lowly of others as a lump of\nstone.",
  
  "When Tao is in action, one's worldly nature can be reversed to the true nature.\nGentleness is the way of application of Tao.\nAll things in the world originate from the manifestation of Tao,\nThe manifestation of Tao is the form of being,\nWhich originates from the non-being of the void, the Great Tao.",
  
  "When a superior man heard of Tao,\nHe cultivates himself diligently.\nWhen an average man heard of Tao,\nHe is doubtful, vague and would give up halfway.\nWhen an inferior man heard of Tao,\nHe laughs and thinks of It as foolish.\nIf Tao is not being laughed at,\nIt is not the Great Tao.\nThus, there is a traditional saying of,\nOne who is enlightened with Tao may appear foolish.\nHe who is advancing in Tao may appear to withdraw.\nGreat Tao is plain and simple which can adapt to all circumstances, although It may seem\nuneven and rough.\nA man of superior virtue is like an empty, receptive valley.\nA man of innocence may appear to be disgraced.\nA man of great virtue appears to be deficient.\nA man who practices Tao and actively achieves great merits may appear gentle and meek.\nA man who follows his true self may appear to be changeable.\nGenerosity has no rough angels.\nGreat achievement is time consuming, and is slow to complete.\nGreat tone has no sound.\nGreat Tao is formless,\nIt is invisible and has no name.\nIt benefits all and fulfills all.",
  
  "Tao gives birth to one.\nOne gives birth to two.\nTwo gives birth to three.\nThree gives birth to all things and all beings.\nAll beings bear the negative physical form which is represented by Ying, and embrace the\npositive true nature which is represented by Yang.\nWith the union of these two, they arrive at a state of harmony.\nMen dislike to be \"the solitude,\" \"the unworthy,\" and \"the virtueless,\"\nYet the Lords and nobles call themselves these names.\nHence, things are benefited by being humble, and damaged by profiting.\nWhat the ancients had taught, I shall also teach as such:\nA man of violence who is in disharmony between Ying and Yang that is the physical body and\ntrue self, shall die of an unnatural death.\nThis is the essential of my teaching.",
  
  "The softest of all things can overcome the hardest of all things.\nRegardless of being or the non-being, they all have to return to the empty void to express their\ngentleness.\nThus, I have learned the benefits of natural actions without personal desires.\nVery few can understand the value of wordless teaching and due act of natural Way.",
  
  "Fame and life, which one is of intimacy?\nLife and wealth, which one is of importance?\nTo gain one but to lose the other, which is of harm?\nTherefore, if one's desires are great, one would result in exhaustion.\nOverstock shall result in heavy loss.\nHe who is contented will not suffer disgrace.\nHe who knows his true nature will not incur danger.\nIt is in this Way that one can long endure.",

  "When the world lives in accord with Tao,\nFine walking horses can be retired form plowing the field.\nWhen the world fails to live in accord with Tao,\nEven pregnant mares are used as war horses,\nAnd were forced to breed in the battlefield.\nThe greatest crime is to have too much desire.\nThe greatest disaster is not to find contentment.\nThe greatest mistake is to desire for endless possession.\nHence, when one is gratified with self-contentment,\nTrue contentment can then long endure.",
  
  "Tao exists in one's own true self.\nIt cannot be found outside of one's true nature.\nHence, there is no need to leave the house to take journey in order to know the world.\nThere is no need to look outside of the window to see the nature of Tao.\nThe further one departs from Tao, the less one will be able to know.\nTherefore a saint is wise to know without seeking for It.\nHe is wise to understand without seeing It.\nHe is wise to accomplish according to the Natural Way.",
  
  "In pursuing knowledge, one learns with intellect and desires.\nTherefore one's knowledge is accumulated day after day.\nIn pursuing Tao, one is enlightened with the true nature and thus diminishes daily one's worldly\ndesires and knowledge.\nThe continuous depletion of one's desires persists until one acts accordingly to the natural Way.\nBy acting without personal intention enables one to accomplish all things.\nTherefore, to rule over the world,\nOne must act naturally without personal desires.\nIf one pursues with extreme effort, one shall fail to rule the world.",
  
  "The saint has no set mind,\nHe regards the wish of the people as his own wish.\nHe is kind to the kind, he is also kind to the unkind.\nThis is the true virtue of kindness.\nThe saint trusts those who are trustworthy.\nHe also trusts those who are not trustworthy.\nThis is the true virtue of trust.\nThe saint conducts himself in the world by harmonizing with all beings to be at one.\nThe worldly people thus look up to him attentively with their eyes and ears.\nAnd the saint treats the people like a loving mother who loves her children unconditionally.",

  "Tao gives birth to all things.\nAnd Te (virtue) nurtures them.\nMatter shapes them.\nThe natural environment matures them.\nTherefore, all things abide by Tao and honor Te.\nAlthough Tao deserves reverence and Te deserves honor,\nThey are not demanded by decree,\nBut is a result of the Nature Way.\nHence, Tao gives life to all beings and Te nurtures, grows, fosters, develops, matures, supports,\nand protects them.\nTao gives birth to life and yet claims no possession.\nIt gives support without holding on to the merit.\nIt matures them but does not take control of.\nThis is called the Mystic Te.",
  
  "The beginning of the universe is Tao,\nIt is the mother of all.\nBy knowing the Mother, we will know her creations.\nBy knowing the creation of all lives, one can then return to the origin and abide by the Mother.\nIt is in this way that although the body dies, the spiritual nature will not perish.\nTo abide by the Mother of Tao is to keep guard on one's sensory desire and shut the doors of\ntemptation so as to prevent one from pursuing outwards.\nThus, by doing so one's whole life may be preserved from exhaustion and pains.\nHowever, if on the contrary one indulges oneself in the pleasure of desire and opens the door of\ntemptation to pursue outwards,\nThen one's true nature will be lost and hence is beyond rescuing.\nThose who are aware of the essence of the original nature are said to be enlightened.\nThose who abide by the gentleness of Tao are said to be strong.\nThose who employ the glory of Tao,\nAnd were able to return to the true nature, are ensured of no distress and is said to embrace the\nNature Tao.",
  
  "If I were to have the very slight insight,\nI would live in accordance with the Great Tao.\nMy only fear is, to go astray from Tao while spreading it.\nGreat Tao is smooth and plain, yet people prefer the devious bypaths.\nHence, the government is corrupted with luxury and splendor.\nThe people were exhausted with labor and left the fields to be wasted and the granaries depleted.\nUnder such practices, the officials would wear fine clothes,\nCarry sharp swords and indulge themselves in good food and drinks.\nThey crave with greed to possess great wealth.\nSuch is said to commit the crime of robbery and certainly is not the Way of Tao.",
  
  "One who cultivates himself with Tao,\nFirmly establishes his virtue.\nHe holds on faithfully to the Great Oneness,\nAnd is honored for generations ever after.\nCultivate oneself with the Oneness, Tao and the virtue is genuine.\nCultivate a family with the Oneness, Tao and the virtue is in surplus.\nCultivate an entire village with the Oneness, Tao and the virtue is enduring.\nCultivate a whole nation with the Oneness, Tao and the virtue is luxuriant.\nCultivate the whole world with the Oneness, Tao and the virtue is universal.\nHence, by cultivating oneself, thus gains insight into one's true virtue.\nBy cultivating a family, thus gains insight into a loving family.\nBy cultivating a village, thus gains insight into a harmonious village.\nBy cultivating a nation, thus gains insight into the extensive benefits for the people.\nBy cultivating the whole world, thus gains insight into the universal peace that embrace all\nbeings.\nHow do I know that the world is so?\nIt is through this Way.",
  
  "One who preserves Te (virtue) in fullness,\nIs to be compared to an innocent infant.\nHence, no poisonous insects will sting him.\nNo wild beasts will attack him.\nNo birds of prey will pounce upon him.\nIn governing one's life, learn from an infant as such:\nIts bones are soft, its tendons are tender, yet its grip is firm.\nNo knowing the unity of male and female,\nYet the infant's sexual organ is aroused.\nThis is because its life essence is pure and complete.\nCrying all day, yet the infant's voice does not turn hoarse.\nSuch is the perfect harmony.\nTo know harmony is called \"Everlasting.\"\nTo know everlasting is called \"Enlightenment.\"\nTo overprotect one's life is called \"Ill omen.\"\nTo let one's mind follow the emotional impulse is called \"Compulsion.\"\nWhen things reach their prime they start to age and decline.\nThis is the life that is diminishing, which shall not reach the ultimate essence.",
  
  "The wise does not speak.\nHe who speaks is not wise.\nKeep silent and close one's mouth.\nKeep guard on one's sensory organs.\nRound off one's edges.\nUntie the entangled.\nHarmonize with the glory.\nMix with the lowliness.\nThis is called the Mystic Unity.\nBecause the wise is unified with all and has no distinction,\nThus, one cannot get close to him,\nNor can one keep far away from him,\nOne cannot benefit him,\nNor can one harm him,\nOne cannot honor him,\nNor can one disgrace him.\nTherefore, he is honored by the whole world.",
  
  "Govern a nation with the right principle,\nFight a battle with the tactics of surprise,\nRule over the world with peace and natural effort.\nHow do I know that this so?\nBy the following:\nThe more prohibitions that are imposed on people,\nThe poorer the people become.\nThe more sharp weapons the people possess,\nThe greater is the chaos in the country.\nThe more clever and crafty the people become,\nThe more unusual affairs occur.\nThe more laws and regulations that exist,\nThe more thieves and brigands appear.\nHence, the saint declares:\nI act effortlessly with the Way of Tao,\nThus, people transform themselves naturally.\nI love tranquility and peach,\nThus, people naturally follow the right Way.\nI do not exhaust people with labor,\nThus, people naturally are wealthy.\nI have no personal desires,\nThus, people naturally are innocent and simple.",
  
  "When the government is dull,\nPeople are simple and sincere.\nWhen the government is complex and stringent,\nPeople are cunning and shall cause trouble.\nCalamity is what blessings depend upon.\nIn blessings there hides the calamity.\nWho knows the ultimate end of the cycle of calamity and blessings?\nIs there no true principle that exists?\nThe normal may revert and become unusual.\nThe good may revert and turn into evil.\nLong indeed, man has been under such delusion.\nTherefore, the saint abides by firm principle and does not depart from it.\nHe is honest and not mean.\nHe is upright and not rue.\nHe is honored and not eminent.",
  
  "In governing one's life and serving the nature,\nThere is nothing better than to follow the Way of simplicity.\nSimplicity is to restrain one's desires.\nTo restrain one's desires is to practice the virtue of Nature Way.\nBy practicing the virtue of Nature Way,\nOne is capable to accomplish anything.\nWith the ability to accomplish anything,\nOne can achieve the infinite realm.\nBy achieving the infinite realm,\nOne can then become a true leader of a nation.\nTo govern a nation with the Law of Nature is to be long enduring.\nThis is regarded as a profound and firm foundation of the everlasting Tao.",
  
  "Ruling a great nation is like frying small fish.\nWhen they are over stirred, they will break into pieces.\nGuide the world with Tao,\nThen the spiritual beings would lose their power.\nIt is in fact not that the spiritual beings had lost their power,\nBut that their spiritual power cannot harm people,\nBut that the true nature of the saint has harmonized with the spiritual power and hence will cause\nno harm.\nSince they both do not harm each other,\nTherefore they will harmonize with the true virtue to embrace the Oneness, Tao.",
  
  "A great nation rules by placing itself in a lowly position like the rivers that flow into the low\nregions of ocean.\nHence, people will naturally be faithful to their country.\nMother nature always stays calm and quiet to overcome the unrest.\nIt takes the lowly position to be in peace.\nThus, if a great nation can lower itself to deal with a smaller nation,\nThen it shall win the heart of the people.\nAnd the smaller nation will willingly merge with the great nation.\nAnd if the smaller nation can lower itself to deal with the great nation,\nThen it shall win the trust and be accommodated as a part of the great nation.\nTherefore, be it to take a lowly position to win over or to take a lowly position to be\naccommodated;\nThe great nation only wishes to unite and shelter all the people,\nWhile the small nation only wishes to be a part of the nation to serve it.\nNow that both are granted with what they wish for,\nIt is only natural for the \"Great\" to put itself in a lowly position.",
  
  "Tao is the wonder of all creations.\nIt is a treasure for those who are kind.\nIt can also protect those who are not kind.\nWords of Tao can benefit all people.\nIts action can guide people to follow the right Way.\nThose who have gone astray, the all-forgiving Tao will not abandon them.\nTherefore, it is better to embrace this precious Tao than to be crowned as kings or appointed as\nministers or to possess wealth and fine horses.\nSo why did the ancients value and honor this Tao?\nIt is because \"Those who seek will attain, those who offended will be forgiven.\"\nThus, It is the greatest honor in the world.",
  
  "Act without personal desire.\nManage without intentional concern.\nTaste without desire of the flavor.\nHold the same regard for big or small, abundant or little and reward the unkind with kindness.\nPlan for the difficult while it is easy.\nAct upon the great from the beginning of the minute.\nAll difficult affairs must be taken care of when they are easy.\nAll great accomplishments must be performed from the small tasks.\nHence, a saint does not strive to do something great.\nAnd as a result he is able to accomplish the great.\nHe who makes promises easily seldom keeps his words.\nHe who constantly regards things as easy shall result in difficulty.\nTherefore, the saint is aware of the difficulties ahead and hence is cautious in managing affairs\nwhile they are sill easy and small to prevent resulting into problems.",
  
  "It is easy to preserve when things are stable.\nIt is easy to plan ahead when things have no yet occurred.\nIf one waits until the affair has begun,\nThen the situation is as brittle as ice that easily cracks and is fragile that easily shatters.\nTake actions before things occur.\nManage before things get out of order.\nA huge tree grows from a tiny sprout;\nA nine-story high terrace is built from heaps of earth.\nA journey of thousand miles begins from the first step.\nHe who acts with desire shall fail.\nHe who tries to possess shall lose.\nTherefore, the saint acts without effort and so he does not fail.\nHe is not eager to possess and so he does not lose.\nMost people fail when they are near completion.\nIf one can be cautious from beginning to end, then he will not fail.\nThus a saint pursues what people do not pursue.\nHe does not value the hard-to-get objects.\nHe learns what people do not learn and avoids the faults in order to restore his true nature.\nHe follows the course of nature to benefit all things and dares not go astray from the right Way,\nTao.",
  
  "The ancient Tao cultivators,\nDid not lead people to acquire knowledge to be tricky,\nBut to guide them to restore their simplicity and innocence.\nThe reason people are difficult to be governed is because they are clever and witty.\nTherefore, he who rules a nation with tactics and wits shall do harm to the country.\nHe who does not rule with such is the nation's blessing.\nTo know these two principles is to know the rule of nature.\nTo know the rule of nature is called Mystic Te (Mystic Virtue).\nMystic Te is profound and far-reaching.\nIt can guide all things to return to their original nature,\nAnd thus great harmony can be achieved.",
  
  "The reason that river and ocean can be the Lords of all valley is because they are located in the\nlowly position.\nTherefore, the saint humbles himself to serve all people.\nAnd he leads the people by putting himself last for the sake of the people's welfare.\nThus, although he rules above the people,\nThe people do not feel him as a burden.\nAlthough he leads in front of the people,\nThe people do not feel him as a threat.\nHence, the world supports him with no objection.\nThis is because he does not contend,\nTherefore, he is above all competition.",
  
  "The whole world says the Tao that I have attained is so great that It seems unreal.\nBecause It is indeed so great, thus It seemed unreal.\nIf It were real, It would have been insignificantly small.\nI have Three Treasures that I hold and guard.\nThe first is Kindness.\nThe second is Simplicity.\nThe third is Humbleness.\nWith Kindness, one can be courageous.\nWith Simplicity, one can be generous.\nWith Humbleness, one can be the lead to provide guidance.\nNow, if one abandons kindness and yet tries to be courageous,\nIf one abandons simplicity and yet tries to be generous.\nIf one abandons humbleness and yet tries to lead as guidance,\nHe is doomed to perish.\nOne who fights a battle with kindness shall win.\nOne who keeps guard with kindness shall secure.\nEven the great nature shall save him and protect him with kindness.",
  
  "A faithful Tao cultivator does not use force.\nA good warrior does not lose his temper.\nA great conqueror does not challenge others.\nA good leader is humble.\nThis is called the virtue of peace with no contention.\nThis is also regarded as competence to make good use of the effort of people.\nSuch is regarded as achieving harmony with nature.\nSuch is the perfect Oneness of true nature.",
  
  "In warfare, there is a saying of such strategy:\nI would rather take a defensive position than to make an initial offensive move.\nI would rather withdraw a foot than to march forward one inch.\nSuch is called to advance without advancement;\nTo defeat without arm force;\nTo fight as if there were no enemy;\nTo carry weapons as if there were no weapons and thus no need for the use of weapons.\nThere is no greater disaster than to underestimate the enemy.\nTo do so may cost one to lose his valuable life.\nTherefore, when two armies engage in a battle,\nThe party that feels the sorrow of killing shall win.",
  
  "My words of Tao is easy to understand and to practice.\nHowever, the world can neither understand nor practice them.\nIn my words of Tao, there is the subtle truth.\nIn my deeds, there is the Way of Tao.\nBecause people do not understand these,\nTherefore they do not understand me.\nThose who know me are few.\nHence, the essence of Tao appears to be more honorable and precious.\nThus, a saint may dress in ordinary coarse clothing,\nYet has a heart of gem with the true essence within.",
  
  "One who knows what people do not know,\nIs a person of enlightenment.\nOne who pretends to know what he is ignorant of, is at fault.\nHe who is aware of what he does not know, shall not be at fault.\nTherefore, a saint is flawless for he is aware of what he truly knows and what he knows not,\nhence he is flawless.",
  
  "When people do not respect the authority,\nThere shall be great misfortune.\nDo not interfere with the people's livelihood.\nDo not despise their living.\nBecause there is no detest against the people,\nTherefore the people do not detest against the authority.\nThe saint realizes his true nature and hence\nDoes not distinguish himself.\nHe has a sense of self-respect and thus does not exalt himself.\nTherefore, he rejects those that are self-distinguished and self-exalted.\nAnd abides by these that are self-awareness and self-respect.",
  
  "He who is brave in being daring, acts recklessly and shall be killed.\nHe who is brave but acts cautiously and kindly shall live.\nOf these two, one is beneficial while the other is harmful.\nWhat nature wishes, who may know what the reasons are?\nThus, the saint is aware of the subtlety and profoundness of the Nature's Way,\nSo he takes great caution in practicing It.\nThe Tao of Nature,\nDoes not contend, yet easily wins.\nDoes not speak, yet always responds.\nDoes not summon, yet all things gather.\nDoes not contemplate as if at ease,\nYet all plans were devised perfectly.\nThe Law of Nature is like a giant web,\nAlthough sparsely meshed, nothing can slip through.",
  
  "When people do not fear death,\nThere is no use trying to threaten them with death.\nIf people value their lives, and those who break the law were being executed,\nThen who would dare to commit criminal act?\nThe life and death of all beings are handled by the executioner of Nature.\nThose who substitute the nature executioner to kill,\nIs like replacing the master carpenter to chop the wood.\nOne who substitutes the master carpenter to chop the wood,\nRarely does not hurt his hands.",
  
  "People starved because the ruler taxed too heavily.\nPeople are difficult to be ruled,\nBecause the ruler governs with personal desire and establishes too many laws to confuse the\npeople.\nTherefore the people are difficult to be ruled.\nPeople take death lightly,\nBecause the ruler pursues after luxurious life and depletes the people.\nTherefore the people take death lightly.\nOne who does not value his life with self-desire, truly cherishes his life.",
  
  "When a man is alive, he is soft and supple.\nWhen he dies, the body becomes hard and stiff.\nWhen a plant is alive, it is soft and flexible.\nWhen it is dead, it becomes dry and brittle.\nTherefore, hard and rigid shall lead to death.\nSoft and gentle shall lead to life.\nThus, a strong army with rigid force shall not win.\nA thick and big tree will be cut down for its use.\nThe big and strong will take an inferior position.\nThe soft and gentle will take superior position.",
  
  "The Tao of Nature is like stretching a bow.\nWhen the stretch is too high, it needs to be pressed down.\nWhen the stretch is too low, it needs to be raised high.\nThe excess will be reduced.\nThe deficient will be replenished.\nThe Tao of Nature is to reduce the excessive and to replenish the insufficient.\nThe Tao of man, however is otherwise.\nIt takes from the needy to serve those who already have a surplus.\nWho can spare one's surplus to serve the world?\nA person of Tao.\nThus, a saint acts without holding on to the achievements.\nHe accomplishes but does not claim for credit.\nHe has no desire to distinguish himself.",
  
  "There is nothing in this world that is softer and meeker than water.\nEven those that can conquer the strong and hard,\nAre still not superior than water.\nNothing can substitute it.\nHence, what is soft can overcome the strong.\nWhat is gentle can overcome the strength.\nThis is known by the world.\nHowever, people cannot put it into practice.\nTherefore, the saint said as follow:\nHe who can take the disgrace of a nation,\nIs said to be the master of the nation.\nHe who can bear the misfortune of a nation,\nIs said to be the ruler of the world.\nTruthful words may seem to be the reverse of worldly practices.",
  
  "When a great resentment has resulted,\nEven if one tries to reconcile and make peace,\nThere is bound to leave some remaining resentment.\nThus, how can this be considered as a good settlement?\nTherefore, a saint cultivates himself with introspection and self-discipline without blaming others\nfor faults.\nThis is like the ancient custom which acts by holding on to the left part of the tally as a debtor\nthat demands nothing from others.\nHence, a person of virtue acts as if he were the debtor.\nAnd a person without virtue acts as if he were the creditor that demands only from others.\nThe Tao of Nature is impersonal which makes no exception to anyone.\nIt always assists those that are kind and virtuous.",
  
  "An ideal nation is small and with few people.\nAlthough there are abundant weapons, there is no need for the use.\nLet the people cherish their life and not pursue after fame and wealth,\nSo that they have no intention to move to faraway places.\nAlthough there are boats and carriages, no one will ride them.\nAlthough there are weapons and armors, there is no occasion to display them.\nLet the people return to the ancient simple life where knotting ropes were used to record every\nevent.\nPeople would then enjoy the simple food, simple clothing, and be contented with a simple life.\nAnd they shall live happily with the traditional customs.\nNeighbors of the nations overlook one another in the near distance.\nThe barks of dogs and crowing of cocks can be heard.\nYet people are so contented that they enjoy their life without ever visiting each other.",
  
  "Words of truth are not pleasing.\nPleasing words are not truthful.\nThe wise one does not argue.\nHe who argues is not wise.\nA wise man of Tao knows the subtle truth,\nAnd may not be learned.\nA learned person is knowledgeable but may not know the subtle truth of Tao.\nA saint does not possess and accumulate surplus for personal desire.\nThe more he helps others, the richer his life becomes.\nThe more he gives to others, the more he gets in return.\nThe Tao of Nature benefits and does not harm.\nThe Way of a saint is to act naturally without contention."
